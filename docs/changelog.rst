Changelog

v.04.00
-------

**Edge Loop Split — persistent setup fields**

- The Edge Loop Split no longer reads from the live viewport selection.
  Three dedicated persistent fields must be filled once per session:
  *Upper Vtx*, *Lower Vtx*, and *Edgeloop* (captured via **Get** buttons).
- The three fields are grouped under a collapsible **Edge Loop Options**
  disclosure row. Click it to expand or collapse the setup panel.
- The ``seed_upper`` / ``seed_lower`` naming is now used throughout the
  core function, replacing the ambiguous ``seed_a`` / ``seed_b``.

**Center side renamed M_ → C_**

- All auto-generated center/bilateral targets now use ``C_`` as the side
  token instead of ``M_``.
- The default side tokens in the Naming Convention dialog are now
  ``R`` / ``C`` / ``L``.
- The built-in Check Shapes default list has been updated accordingly.

**Check Shapes — external JSON**

- The reference list is now stored in
  ``resources/check_shapes_default.json`` (shipped with the tool) instead
  of being hard-coded in the source.
- A **File** menu (Load… / Save… / Reset to Default) replaces the old
  button toolbar. The last loaded file path is remembered across sessions.
- The current file name is shown in the dialog title bar.

**Check Shapes — Match Existing to List**

- New **Match existing to List** button opens a *Rename Suggestions* dialog.
- Matches targets to the reference list using token sets (order-independent).
- Also detects targets missing a side prefix (``C_``, ``L_``, or ``R_``)
  and proposes adding it.
- Ambiguous matches are highlighted in orange *(Not sure)* and unchecked by
  default.

**Naming Convention — side token fields**

- Three new fields in the Naming Convention dialog: **Left**, **Center**,
  **Right** (defaults: ``L``, ``C``, ``R``).
- The Split and symmetric operations read these values at runtime, so
  non-standard side conventions work without code changes.

**Actions section — topology edge field moved to top**

- The **Edge** field (topology-symmetry centered edge) is now the first
  control in the Actions section, above all operation buttons.

**Maya Tools Shelf — second row**

- The top shelf now has two rows.
- Row 2 adds three sculpt brushes: **Relax**, **Pinch**, **Amplify**
  (all with double-click to open Tool Settings).
- **Add Target**, **Clean Blendshape Node**, and **Reset All Targets to 0**
  are now grouped together in Row 2, separated from the sculpt tools.
- Space after the separator is reserved for future tools.

**New buttons**

- **Reset All Targets to 0** (shelf row 2) — sets every target weight on the
  blendShape node(s) to 0; useful to return to neutral after previewing shapes.
- **Bake Deformers** (Actions section) — bakes the contribution of all
  deformers above the blendShape into the selected targets, then the deformer
  can be deleted. Works on multiple targets in one pass.

**Actions section — open by default**

- The Actions section now starts fully open instead of compact.

**Bug fix — scroll jump on section toggle**

- Fixed a bug where opening or closing any collapsible section caused the
  scroll area to jump to the top of the panel.

**UI stability**

- Fixed flickering double-open when dragging the installer into Maya a
  second time.
- UI position and dock state are now preserved between sessions
  (``retain=True``).
- Removed ``importlib.reload`` from the shelf button command; the installer
  now re-opens the tool cleanly after installation.
